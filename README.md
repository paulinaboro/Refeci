This is school Project created for KEA "Multimedia Design and Communication". We have created the website for the music collaboration and presented the their album on the website.

I have created a database in "Wordpress" so the clients will be able to add/change the page content by themselves through WordPress platform.

I fetched the JSON RESTful from WordPress and later add it to the HTML pages throgh JavaScript.
